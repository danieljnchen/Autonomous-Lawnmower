IntelliMow is an algorithm for generating paths robots can follow in order to cover a two-dimensional area. The scenario this algorithm handles is for mowing lawns.

## Features
* Minimal double coverage
* Obstacle avoidance
* Multiple lawn configurations
* Editor for creating lawn configurations with ease

## How To Use
* The user inputs the boundaries of their lawn through the editor, then saves the boundaries
* The user then opens up their lawn, and clicks a point on the boundary for the robot to start from
* The algorithm plans a path and displays the path and draws a robot following the generated path

This was created by two students as a high school senior engineering project.
