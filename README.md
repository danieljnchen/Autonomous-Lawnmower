IntelliMow is an algorithm for generating paths robots can follow in order to cover a two-dimensional area. The scenario this algorithm handles is for mowing lawns.

## Features
* Minimal double coverage
* Obstacle avoidance
* Multiple lawn configurations
* Editor for creating lawn configurations with ease

## How To Use
* The user inputs the boundaries of their lawn through the editor, then saves the boundaries

This was created by two students as a high school senior engineering project.
